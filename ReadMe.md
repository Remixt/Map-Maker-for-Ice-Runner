# Map Maker 1.0
## This is a Swing Application for my game "Ice Runner" - https://github.com/Remixt/Project-Ice-Runner
## It allows players to build maps faster and more easily than before, where you needed a slight amount of coding knowledge. 
## Here all of the code is generated automatically.

#How to use:
* The executable jar file is standalone and can be run without any requirements other than having java 1.8 installed on your computer.
* The default save location is the desktop. 
* Once you save the map it needs to be moved into the appropriate player folder for the game. 
 *(Ex. IceRunner/res/player1/maps)
* Once your map is in the appropriate folder you can either restart the game, OR you can go to the main menu and hit the "load maps" button. The game will then automatically load any new maps in either the player 1 or player 2 folder.
