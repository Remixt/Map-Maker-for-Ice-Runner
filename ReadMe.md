# Map Maker 1.0
## This is a Swing Application I designed to make creating maps easier for my game. (Link to my game: https://github.com/Remixt/Project-Ice-Runner )


##The main purpose is to allow faster map creation and to give a visual aid for creating more challenging maps that might be hard to keep track of with pure code.

#How to use:
* The executable jar file is standalone and can be run without any requirements other than having java 1.8 installed on your computer.
* The default save location is the desktop. 
* Once you save the map it needs to be moved into the appropriate player folder for the game. 
 *  (Ex. IceRunner/res/player1/maps)
* Once your map is in the appropriate folder you can either restart the game, OR you can go to the main menu and hit the "load maps" button. The game will then automatically load any new maps in either the player 1 or player 2 folder.
